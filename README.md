## Face-Recognition-Project
**“Facial Detection and Facial Recognition using Intel’s open source Computer
Vision Library (OpenCV) and Python dependency”**
Facial detection and Facial recognition help us in many ways, be it sorting of photos in our
mobile phone gallery by recognizing pictures with their face in them or unlocking a phone by
a mere glance to adding biometric information in the form of face images in the country’s
**unique ID database (Aadhaar)** as an acceptable biometric input for verification. This project
lays out the basic terminology required to understand the implementation of Face Detection
and Face Recognition using Intel’s Computer Vision library called ‘OpenCV’.
It also shows the practical implementation of the Face Detection and Face Recognition using
OpenCV with Python embedding on both Windows as well as macOS platform. The aim of
the project is to implement Facial Recognition on faces that the script can be trained for.
The input is taken from a webcam and the recognized faces are displayed along with their
name in real time.

**Motivation**

We developed this Face Detection Project for our Indian Army, Security CCTV Police
and even Common Use of people to detect Face in single and group of peoples in Images
. This Face Detection Code can be deployed and use in any application camera, security
apps and website to found faces easily.

**Scope of the Project**

To identify and verify terrorists at airports, railway stations and malls the face
recognition technology will be the best choice in India ascompared with other biometric
technologies since other technologies cannot be helpful in crowded places. This
technology can also be used effectively in various _important examinations such as SSC,
HSC, Medical,Engineering, MCA, MBA, B- Pharmacy, Nursing courses_ etc.The examinee
can be identified and verified using FaceRecognition Technique. It can also be deployed
in police station to identify and verifythe criminals. To Identify the Number of student in
classroom. It cancollect in all the number of faces in less than 1 sec. **Easy to take
attendance.**
